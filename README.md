# nextjs-course-demo

This is my demo Next.js Project. In this Project, I built a demo Meetup app (connected to MongoDB atlas) where people can share any meetup place by clicking onto Add New meetup and then by filling the form. The form details will be stored in MongoDB atlas .Once form is submitted it will show the meetup details after few seconds on the New Meetup tab. 

Learned : 
Why Next.js is better than React.js 
Next.js is very easy in terms of routing pages instead of React-router hook.
How to connect with you app with nsql database (MongoDB atlas).

The app is deployed on Vercel (a project by Next.js team). Link: https://nextjs-course-demo-phi-drab.vercel.app/
